# NextJS

## Setup

```
npx create-next-app

or

Npm install next react react-dom
```

## Features

- Automatic compilation and bundling (with webpack and babel)
- React Fast Refresh
- Static generation and server-side rendering of `./pages/`
- Static file serving. `./public/` is mapped to `/`
- NextJS creates a JSON file behind the scenes and uses that data for routing and etc to separate the client and the server
