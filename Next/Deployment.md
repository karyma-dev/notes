# Deployment

- Can use Vercel to host application
  - Optimized for NextJS
    - Every page can use either static or server side rendering
    - Pages that use static generation and assets will be automatically served from Vercel's Edge Network
    - Pages that use server side rendering and api routes will automatically become isolated serverless functions which makes it scalable
  - Custom Domains
  - Environment Variables
  - Automatic HTTPS
