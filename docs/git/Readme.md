# Git

Git is a free and open source version control system, originally created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.[Cheatsheet](cheatsheet.pdf)

## Overview

### Basic overview of how git works :

1. Create a "repository" (project) with a git hosting tool (like Bitbucket)
2. Copy (or clone) the repository to your local machine
3. Add a file to your local repo and "commit" (save) the changes
4. "Push" your changes to your main branch
5. Make a change to your file with a git hosting tool and commit
6. "Pull" the changes to your local machine
7. Create a "branch" (version), make a change, commit the change
8. Open a "pull request" (propose changes to the main branch)
9. "Merge" your branch to the main branch

### Version Control

- Source control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.
- If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members
