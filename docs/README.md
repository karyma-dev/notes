Welcome to my own very personal development handbook. This is where I store all of my knowledge on web development techonologies I have learned and worked with throughout the years.

Studies shows that people forget about 50 - 80% of what they've learned after one day and 97-98% after a month therefore I believe everyone should have their own version of a handbook which they may refer to.
